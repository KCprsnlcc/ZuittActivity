\# HTML Project Documentation

This repository contains a set of HTML examples and exercises designed to illustrate basic web development concepts. The project is divided into two main sections: **Discussion** and **Activity**. The discussion files introduce HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links (both relative and absolute), images, and comments. The activity section features a more comprehensive HTML page that demonstrates a navigation bar, landing section, tool showcase, projects display, and footer with social links.


## File Descriptions

### Discussion Section

- **index.html**  
  This page introduces the HTML basics. It includes:
  - A header and a welcoming paragraph.
  - A numbered list enumerating topics covered in the Free Coding Bootcamp.
  - Relative links to other pages (Attributes and Links).
  - Several images with relative paths.

- **attributes.html**  
  This page explains HTML attributes. It includes:
  - A description of common attributes such as `type`, `id`, `class`, `src`, and `href`.
  - A centered image demonstrating Git VCS.
  - An organized gallery displaying images with descriptions, including a reference to the Zuitt Coding Bootcamp and the PilarEase logo (using a raw GitHub URL).
  - Relative links for navigating back to the Home Page and to the Links page.

- **pages/links.html**  
  This page covers HTML hyperlinks. It includes:
  - An explanation of anchor tags.
  - A list comparing absolute and relative links.
  - Examples of absolute links to external websites (Zuitt Coding Bootcamp, Facebook) that open in a new tab.
  - Relative links that provide navigation back to the Home Page and the Attributes page.

### Activity Section

- **index.html**  
  This page is a comprehensive activity that demonstrates:
  - A navigation bar linking to various sections (Home, Tools, Projects, Contact).
  - A landing section that includes a personal image, name, and introduction (profile of Khadaffe Sulaiman).
  - A Tools section showcasing images of tools (Git, Sublime Text, HTML, CSS) with brief descriptions.
  - A Projects section displaying several project cards with project images and short descriptions. One of the projects references the PilarEaseDJO Django-based platform.

## How to Use

1. **Viewing the Pages:**  
   Open any of the HTML files in a web browser to see the rendered pages. For example:
   - To view the discussion introduction, open `s02/discussion/index.html`.
   - To explore the attributes example, open `s02/discussion/attributes.html`.
   - For HTML hyperlink examples, open `s02/discussion/pages/links.html`.
   - For the activity page, open `s02/activity/index.html`.

2. **Navigation:**  
   - The discussion pages include relative links that allow you to navigate between different topics.
   - The activity page features a navigation bar with anchor links that smoothly scroll to respective sections on the page.

3. **Editing and Experimentation:**  
   - You are welcome to modify the HTML code to experiment with different elements and attributes.
   - The comments in the HTML files serve as documentation to help you understand the purpose of various sections and code segments.

## Concluding Remarks

This repository serves as a foundational guide for understanding essential HTML concepts, including the use of relative and absolute links, attributes, and the overall structure of a webpage. It is ideal for individuals enrolled in the Free Coding Bootcamp at Zuitt or anyone interested in gaining a practical understanding of web development basics.
