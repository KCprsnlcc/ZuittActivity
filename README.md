# HTML Project Documentation

This repository contains a set of HTML examples and exercises designed to illustrate basic web development concepts. The project is divided into two main sections: **Discussion** and **Activity**. The discussion files introduce HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links (both relative and absolute), images, and comments. The activity section features a more comprehensive HTML page that demonstrates a navigation bar, landing section, tool showcase, projects display, and footer with social links.

## File Descriptions

  - Several images with relative paths.

- **attributes.html**  
  This page explains HTML attributes. It includes:
  - A description of common attributes such as `type`, `id`, `class`, `src`, and `href`.

## Concluding Remarks

This repository serves as a foundational guide for understanding essential HTML concepts, including the use of relative and absolute links, HTML attributes, and the overall structure of a webpage. It is ideal for individuals enrolled in the Free Coding Bootcamp at Zuitt or anyone interested in gaining a practical understanding of web development basics. Additionally, the activity section provides a more real-world example of a web project, complete with a personal profile, tool showcase, project display, and interactive footer with social links.
